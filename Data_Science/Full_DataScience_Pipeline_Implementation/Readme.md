# Full data_science pipeline implementation.
### Learn how to implement the full data science pipeline right from collecting the data to implementing ML algorithms.
Phase I:

Here I have scraped data from IMDB website (imdb.py)

Phase II:

I have tried to implement simple ML regression on the data (ml_imdb.py)

Phase III:

I have prepared the data for NLP classification (multilabel_prep.py)

Phase IV:

I have implemented multilabel NLP classifier using various techniques like chain classifier etc. (multilabel_nlp_classifier.ipynb)
